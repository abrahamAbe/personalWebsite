    <p class="projectDescriptionParagraph">Events.com is a mobile-first web application that provides a suite of cloud-based services to encourage 
        social interaction and enhance the experience of putting on, promoting and attending events. It gives organizers the necessary tools
        to manage and monetize their events. Event goers get to discover, explore and share their experiences through the events.com website.</p>

    <p class="projectDescriptionParagraph">I am part of the front-end team, I spend most of my time developing new features for the application, working closely with the design team in order to
       deliver the best user experiences to our customers. Every day is different, from squashing bugs to attending brainstorm engineering sessions, we
       keep an active and creative environment at the office. We work under Agile methodologies which helps us to stay active and always creating new things.</p>
